10.1111/gcb.12131,"Methane emissions from wetlands: biogeochemical, microbial, and modeling perspectives from local to global scales (2013)","Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global CH emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over CH emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in CH biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and CH dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of CH models.","One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review.",Understanding the dynamics of methane (CH) emissions is of paramount importance because CH has  times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide (CO) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas.,(ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes.,"Major uncertainties in estimating current and future CH emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over CH production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing CH biogeochemistry models."
