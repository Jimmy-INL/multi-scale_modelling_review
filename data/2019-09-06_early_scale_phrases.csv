10.1006/jcph.1997.5682,A multiscale finite element method for elliptic problems in composite materials and porous media (1997),"In contrast to some empirical numerical upscaling methods, the multiscale method is systematic and self-consistent, which makes it easier to analyze.","For the same reason, the method has the ability to handle extremely large degrees of freedom due to highly heterogeneous media, which are intractable by conventional finite element (difference) methods.",Parallel implementation and performance of the method are also addressed.,This is accomplished by constructing the multiscale finite element base functions that are adaptive to the local property of the differential operator.,"We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method through extensive numerical experiments, which include problems with random coefficients and problems with continuous scales."

10.1029/92WR00607,A CRITICAL-REVIEW OF DATA ON FIELD-SCALE DISPERSION IN AQUIFERS (1992),"Overall, it is concluded that longitudinal dispersivities in the lower part of the indicated range are more likely to be realistic for field applications.","At a given scale, the longitudinal dispersivity values are found to range over - orders of magnitude and the higher reliability data tend to fall in the lower portion of this range.",It is not appropriate to represent the longitudinal dispersivity data by a single universal line.,The variations in dispersivity reflect the influence of differing degrees of aquifer heterogeneity at different sites.,"Overall, the data indicate a trend of systematic increase of the longitudinal dispersivity with observation scale but the trend is much less clear when the reliability of the data is considered."
10.1002/hyp.3360090305,SCALE ISSUES IN HYDROLOGICAL MODELING - A REVIEW (1995),The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts.,"Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given.",The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling.,The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view.,A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology.
10.1029/97GB00330,A continental phenology model for monitoring vegetation responses to interannual climatic variability (1997),Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of  days in  to a high of  days in .,days in the grassland biome.,days in the grassland biome.,Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.,days in the DBF biome and .
10.1007/BF00139728,EXTREME EVENTS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE - VARIABILITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN AVERAGES (1992),Extreme events act as a catalyst for concern about whether the climate is changing.,"These results provide additional support for the conclusions that experiments using climate models need to be designed to detect changes in climate variability, and that policy analysis should not rely on scenarios of future climate involving only changes in means.",,,
10.1029/98WR02577,Statistical downscaling of general circulation model output: A comparison of methods (1998),The ANN methods performed poorly because of a failure to simulate wet-day occurrence statistics adequately.,Comparisons of results were facilitated by using standard sets of observed and GCM-derived predictor variables and by using a standard suite of diagnostic statistics.,"The downscaling methods compared were different weather generator techniques (the standard ""WGEN"" method, and a method based on spell-length durations), two different methods using grid point vorticity data as an atmospheric predictor variable (B-Circ and C-Circ), and two variations of an artificial neural network (ANN) transfer function technique using circulation data and circulation plus temperature data as predictor variables.",Changes in daily precipitation produced by the GCM between - and - were therefore judged not to be due primarily to changes in atmospheric circulation.,"The weather generation techniques, which are able to fit a number of daily precipitation statistics exactly, yielded the smallest differences between observed and simulated daily precipitation."
10.1029/1999GB900014,Global patterns of terrestrial biological nitrogen (N-2) fixation in natural ecosystems (1999),"Although there have been many studies addressing the microbiology, physiology, and magnitude of N fixation at local scales, there are very few estimates of BNF over large scales.","Our ""best estimate"" of potential nitrogen fixation by natural ecosystems is similar to  Tg N yr(-), with a range of - Tg N yr(-).","However, any attempt to evaluate N cycling processes within ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic influences on the N cycle, requires an understanding of the magnitude of inputs via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF).",We also used net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from the Century terrestrial ecosystem model to examine global relationships between these variables and BNF as well as to compare observed and Century-modeled BNF.,We utilized > preexisting published estimates of BNF to generate biome- and global-level estimates of biological N fixation.
10.1029/1998WR900065,Observed spatial organization of soil moisture and its relation to terrain indices (1999),"A correlation analysis found that In(a), where a is the specific upslope area, was the best univariate spatial predictor of soil moisture for wet conditions and that the potential radiation index was best during dry periods.",We analyze the degree of spatial organization of soil moisture and the ability of terrain attributes to predict that organization.,By organization we mean systematic spatial variation or consistent spatial patterns.,A major limitation on the predictive power of terrain indices is the degree of spatial organization present in the soil moisture pattern at the time for which the prediction is made.,The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the organizing processes and in terms of the use of terrain attributes in hydrologic modeling and scale studies.
