10.1016/j.biocon.2009.02.021,"The Brazilian Atlantic Forest: How much is left, and how is the remaining forest distributed? Implications for conservation (2009)","We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution.","The neotropical Atlantic Forest supports one of the highest degrees of species richness and rates of endemism on the planet, but has also undergone a huge forest loss.",The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation.,The results revealed a serious situation: more than % of the fragments are < ha.,"almost half the remaining forest is < m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large ( m), and nature reserves protect only % of the remaining forest and % of the original forest."
10.1023/B:CLIM.0000013685.99609.9e,Hydrologic implications of dynamical and statistical approaches to downscaling climate model outputs (2004),"Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model.","For the future climate scenario, only the BCSD-method ( using PCM or RCM) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results.","Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (  ) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a future (  - ) PCM climate scenario were also explored.",,

10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01065.x,On the variability of respiration in terrestrial ecosystems: moving beyond Q(10) (2006),probably indicate that some unidentified process of substrate supply is confounded with observed temperature variation.,We speculate that apparent Q() values of respiration that are significantly above about .,"For a simple membrane-bound enzymatic system that follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the temperature sensitivities of maximum enzyme activity (V-max) and the half-saturation constant that reflects the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (K-m) can cancel each other to produce no net temperature dependence of the enzyme.","We also present examples to show that soluble carbon substrate supply is likely to be important at scales ranging from transport across membranes, diffusion through soil water films, allocation to aboveground and belowground plant tissues, phenological patterns of carbon allocation and growth, and intersite differences in productivity.",Recent applications of these equations to data on soil respiration have produced highly variable apparent temperature sensitivities.
10.1007/s10584-006-9211-6,Evaluating the performance and utility of regional climate models: the PRUDENCE project (2007),The main objective of the PRUDENCE project was to provide high resolution climate change scenarios for Europe at the end of the twenty-first century by means of dynamical downscaling (regional climate modelling) of global climate simulations.,A paper summarising the related MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) project is also included.,This special issue of Climatic Change contains a series of research articles documenting coordinated work carried out within a -year European Union project 'Prediction of Regional scenarios and Uncertainties for Defining European Climate change risks and Effects' (PRUDENCE).,The second part of the issue contains  articles that focus in more detail on some of the themes summarised in the overarching papers.,

10.1002/hyp.5611,SWAT2000: current capabilities and research opportunities in applied watershed modelling (2005),"The model has been recoded into Fortran  with a complete data dictionary, dynamic allocation of arrays and modular subroutines.",The model SWAT is meanwhile used in many countries all over the world.,The model SWAT is applicable for this purpose.,"Nineteen selected papers with issues reaching from the newest developments, the evaluation of river basin management, interdisciplinary approaches for river basin management, the impact of land use change, methodical aspects and models derived from SWAT are published in this special issue.","It is a flexible model that can be used under a wide range of different environmental conditions, as this special issue will show."
10.1016/S0309-1708(02)00056-8,Statistics of extremes in hydrology (2002),How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper.,"Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation.","Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches.","In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere-ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered.",

10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.98081.x,A survey and overview of habitat fragmentation experiments (2000),Our survey revealed  fragmentation experiments worldwide.,We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies.,"Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.",Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the root causes of many conservation problems.,Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species.
